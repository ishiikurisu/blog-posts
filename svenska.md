### Consonants

Most consonants sound like they counterpart in Esperanto.

If the first letter in a word is _g_ and if the next letter is a soft vowel then the _g_ is pronounced as a `ĵ` from Esperanto.

If the first letter in a word is _k_ and if the next letter is a soft vowel then the _k_ is pronounced as an `ŝ` from Esperanto.

Doubling consonants makes the preceding vowel a short one.

_kj_ sounds like `ŝ`. 

`sj` sounds like IPA /ɧ/. IPA describes this sound as "simultaneous ŝ and ĥ".
